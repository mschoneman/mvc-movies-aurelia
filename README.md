# mvc-movies-aurelia
This is an effort to convert the ASP.NET sample MvcMovies app 
(https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Getting-Started-with-91a65652) to a Single Page Application using Aurellia (http://aurelia.io/).

The SPA will communicate with the same back end database, using BreezeJS (http://www.getbreezenow.com/) to handle data wrangling.

My goal initial goal is to make things work as closely as possible to the original.
